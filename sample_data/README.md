# Sample Course Files

Add your own GPX course files to this folder and they'll appear in the "Load Sample Course" dropdown.

## How to Get GPX Files

1. **Strava Routes**: Create or find a route, click "Export GPX"
2. **RideWithGPS**: Download any route as GPX
3. **Garmin Connect**: Export courses from your device/account
4. **Komoot**: Export routes as GPX
5. **Your head unit**: Most devices let you export courses

## Tips

- Rename files to something descriptive (e.g., `mt_washington_hillclimb.gpx`)
- The filename becomes the display name (underscores → spaces, Title Case)
- Higher resolution GPX files work better (more trackpoints)
- Files should have elevation data for accurate pacing

## Example File Naming

```
sample_data/
  mt_washington_hillclimb.gpx     → "Mt Washington Hillclimb"
  local_10mi_tt_course.gpx        → "Local 10mi Tt Course"
  alpe_d_huez.gpx                 → "Alpe D Huez"
```
